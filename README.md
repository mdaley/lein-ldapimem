# lein-ldapimem (LDAP i[n] mem[ory])

A Leiningen 2 plugin that runs a simple embedded instance of unboundID's in memory LDAP service. Useful for testing purposes.

## Usage

Add `[lein-ldapimem "0.1.0"]` to the `:plugin` vector of your project.

Start the LDAP service when running lein by specifying it before the other tasks that you are running, for example:

    $ lein ldapimem run
    
Once the task completes, the LDAP service will be terminated.

If for some reason you'd like to run the plugin by itself you can invoke it like this, without any further tasks:

    $ lein ldapimem

When you want to stop it just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

## Configuration

There are optional pieces of configuration that control how the LDAP service operates:

```clojure
(defproject my-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :plugins [[lein-ldapimem "0.1.0"]]
  ...
  :ldapimem {:port 9839 ;optional - default value is 8389
             :basedn "dc=dev,dc=mycorp,dc=com" ;optional base domain - default is dc=example,dc=com
             :ldif-file-path "ldif.txt; optional - path of file containing valid LDIF data
             :schema-file-path "schema.txt"; optional - path of file containing the schema
             :noschema ; optional - no schema is to be used (not even the default one)
             :logging true} ; optional - default is false
  ...
)

## Notes

* The LDAP service only has one unencrypted listener (which is probably enough for local testing).\
* If you want to run many lein builds in parallel using Jenkins, try the [Port Allocator Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Port+Allocator+Plugin) to avoid port conflicts. If you assign a port to $LDAP_PORT, you can set the `:port` config option for embongo like:

```clojure
(defproject my-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :ldapimem {
    :port ~(Integer. (get (System/getenv) "LDAP_PORT" 8389)) ;uses 8389 if env variable not set
  ...
```
